This folder is forked from https://github.com/plctlab/riscv-operating-system-mooc, which is a github repository for a riscv os course.

This folder contains the basic instruction test of riscv core, which enables us to generate the test ROM file with a little bit modification of the linking scripts.

1. QEMU
QEMU (Quick Emulator) is explored as a tool for operating system development. It delves into how QEMU can be used to emulate hardware, thus providing a platform for developers to test and debug their operating system code on various CPU architectures without needing the physical hardware.
2. Assembly
Assembly language is used in operating system development through a repository of source files. Each file demonstrates a specific assembly instruction, reflecting the language's direct hardware interaction and its role in executing low-level system operations. The section underscores assembly's importance in tasks like bootstrapping, interrupt handling, and system performance optimization.
3. Operating System
Operating System written by Assembly and C outlines the practical components of operating system functionality, covering initial boot processes, fundamental system operations like memory and process management, and mechanisms for handling interrupts and system calls. It provides a high-level view of how the kernel manages these tasks and the architecture of the operating system's core.
