## Background
Over the last decade, the computing industry has steadily moved from CISC to RISC, especially in low-power use cases, or where performance/watt is of utmost importance. This is a direct response to the ever-growing need for more powerful, efficient computing, especially in embedded and edge applications. Our proposed solution is to provide the front-end, RTL design of a pipelined processor (with a currently indeterminate pipeline stage count) that realizes the RV32I instruction set. Additionally, the processor is aimed as a general-purpose biomedical application processor and thus requires integrated interface support, such as SPI, UART, etc. for ADC/DAC and other peripheral control. The aim is to provide a synthesizable RTL core with a fully validated module-level/unit-test level design.
## Architecture
- Harvard architecture.
- Supports 5-stage pipeline.
- ITCM/DTCM memory for instruction/data storage.
- AMBA AHB bus used for CPU, memory communication and Core control unit.
- AMBA APB and AHB2APB bus used for peripherals.
- Support UART, SPI, GPIO peripherals.
- Sychronous and Asychronous FIFO for data transmission.
- Temporarily no cache and MMU.
